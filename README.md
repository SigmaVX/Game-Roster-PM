# Game-Roster-PM
Game Roster was started in 2015 and grew to over 50,000 users without outside financing.  The app allows user to originaize games, find players, and build interactive gaming communities.  The website, Discord bot, and native apps (Android/iOS) helped connect gamers.  The site was shut down in early 2020.
